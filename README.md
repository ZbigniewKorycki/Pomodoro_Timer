<h1>Pomodoro Timer</h1>

This Python script and Tkinter-based graphical user interface (GUI) implement a Pomodoro timer, a time management technique that encourages productivity and focus by breaking work into intervals with short breaks in between. The application includes features to start, reset, and track completed Pomodoro sessions. 

The project was done as part of the course "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023" (https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) - Day 28.
